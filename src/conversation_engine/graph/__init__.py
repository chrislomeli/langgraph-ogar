"""
Conversation graph — LangGraph orchestration layer.

This package wires a domain-agnostic conversation loop that delegates
all domain logic to an injected ConversationContext.

The loop topology (preflight → validate → converse → route) is fixed.
The *domain* is pluggable: implement ConversationContext for your
domain and pass it in via state.

Infrastructure is injected at build time:
- interceptors / middleware via build_conversation_graph(...)
- LLM callable via state["llm"]
- Human surface via state["human"]
- Tool client via state["tool_client"]
- Error handling via ErrorHandlingMiddleware
