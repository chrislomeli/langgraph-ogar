"""
ConversationContext protocol — the contract between the conversation loop
and any domain that plugs into it.

The loop is domain-agnostic: it validates, reasons, responds, and routes.
The *context* supplies domain-specific validation, finding types, and
state management.  Different domains implement this protocol to reuse
the same conversation loop.

Design principles:
- Protocol, not ABC — structural subtyping, no inheritance required
- Domain types stay behind the boundary — the loop sees Finding, not Assessment
- Immutable findings — the loop reads them, only the context produces them
- The context owns the domain state; the loop owns conversation mechanics
