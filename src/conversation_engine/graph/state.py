"""
Conversation graph state definitions.

Three separate schemas keep concerns clean:
- ConversationInput  — what the parent graph passes in (the contract boundary)
- ConversationOutput — what the subgraph returns (the contract boundary)
- ConversationState  — the internal working state (never crosses the boundary)

Design principles:
- Domain-agnostic — the state knows about Findings, not Assessments
- The ConversationContext protocol is the only bridge to domain specifics
- Minimal fields — only add what a node actually reads or writes
- The subgraph does NOT own the checkpointer, LLM client, or human surface
- Grows organically as new nodes demand new fields
