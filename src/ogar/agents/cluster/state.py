ogar.agents.cluster.state

State schema for the cluster agent LangGraph subgraph.

What is a cluster agent?
────────────────────────
One cluster agent runs per geographic/logical cluster of sensors.
Its job is to:
  1. Accumulate sensor events from its cluster (rolling window).
  2. Run a LangGraph tool loop to classify anomalies.
  3. Report findings (structured anomaly records) upward to the supervisor.

The cluster agent is a LangGraph subgraph — it has its own state schema
that is separate from the supervisor's state.  The supervisor maps
its own state in/out when it invokes the cluster agent subgraph.

State design principles
────────────────────────
  - Only fields that at least one node reads OR writes belong here.
  - Fields the LLM tool loop needs (messages) use LangGraph's add_messages
    reducer so new messages are appended rather than overwriting the list.
  - sensor_events uses a custom reducer (append-only) for the same reason:
    we want to accumulate events across invocations, not replace them.
  - Fields are Optional where they may not be set yet at graph start.

Node responsibilities (skeleton — logic comes later)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ingest_events    : Receives incoming SensorEvent, adds to sensor_events.
                     Sets status to "processing".
  classify         : LLM tool loop node.  Reads sensor_events and messages.
                     Uses tools to query history, cross-reference readings.
                     Writes anomalies when detected.
  report_findings  : Packages anomalies into Finding objects for the supervisor.
                     Sets status to "complete".
