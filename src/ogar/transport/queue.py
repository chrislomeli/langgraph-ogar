ogar.transport.queue

In-process async event queue — the pre-Kafka transport layer.

Why this exists
───────────────
Before we wire in Kafka, we need something that:
  - Decouples the sensor publisher from the bridge consumer.
  - Provides back-pressure (publisher blocks if consumer is slow).
  - Is easy to swap out for a real Kafka consumer later.

This module wraps asyncio.Queue with a typed interface that matches
the shape we'll eventually want from a Kafka consumer wrapper.
When we add Kafka, the bridge consumer can switch from reading
SensorEventQueue to reading a KafkaConsumerWrapper — the bridge
code itself does not change.

Kafka comparison
────────────────
asyncio.Queue is single-process only.  Kafka is distributed.
For the demo this doesn't matter — everything runs in one process.
The architecture already separates concerns correctly:
  sensors → queue → bridge consumer → workflow runner
The "queue" is the only thing that changes when Kafka arrives.

Back-pressure
─────────────
The queue has a configurable max size.  When full, put() blocks
the publisher coroutine.  This is intentional — it means the
system slows down rather than accumulating unbounded memory when
agents can't keep up.  In production Kafka would handle this via
consumer lag monitoring.

Usage
─────
  queue = SensorEventQueue(maxsize=100)
  await queue.put(event)                  # publisher side
  event = await queue.get()              # consumer side
  queue.task_done()                      # mark event processed
