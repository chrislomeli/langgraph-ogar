ogar.sensors.publisher

Async sensor publisher loop.

Responsibility
──────────────
The publisher sits between sensors and the transport layer.
Its only job is:
  1. Call emit() on each registered sensor at regular tick intervals.
  2. Put the resulting SensorEvent onto the event queue.
  3. Skip None returns (dropout mode) silently.

The publisher does NOT know about Kafka, LangGraph, or agents.
It only knows about sensors and the event queue interface.

Why async?
──────────
In a real system sensors would be I/O-bound (reading from hardware,
network sockets, or a simulation engine).  async lets multiple sensors
tick concurrently without blocking each other.

In this mock setup the sensors are purely CPU-bound (random number
generation), but the async structure is already correct for when we
swap in a real world engine or Kafka producer.

Tick interval
─────────────
The tick_interval_seconds parameter controls how fast the simulation
runs.  Set it low (0.1s) for fast scenario testing.  Set it to match
wall-clock time (1.0s) for realistic demos.

Usage
─────
  queue = SensorEventQueue()
  publisher = SensorPublisher(sensors=[temp_sensor, smoke_sensor], queue=queue)
  await publisher.run()        # runs forever until cancelled
  # or:
  await publisher.run(ticks=50)  # runs for exactly 50 ticks then stops

    Async loop that ticks all registered sensors and enqueues their events.

    Each call to run() ticks all sensors in sequence, waits for

    registration order — not in parallel — to keep the tick counter
    consistent across sensors.
