ogar.bridge.consumer

Async event bridge consumer — reads SensorEvents from a queue
and dispatches them to cluster agent graphs.

Responsibility
──────────────
The consumer sits between the transport queue and the agent layer.
For each event it:
  1. Reads the event's cluster_id.
  2. Looks up (or creates) the compiled cluster agent graph for that cluster.
  3. Invokes the graph with the event as the trigger.
  4. Collects the resulting AnomalyFindings and stores them.

In a production system this would be a Kafka consumer group with
partition assignment by cluster_id.  Here it is a single async loop
reading from SensorEventQueue.

Why async?
──────────
Agent graph invocations may involve LLM calls (I/O-bound).
Running as an async consumer lets us process events without blocking
the publisher or other consumers.

Usage
─────
  consumer = EventBridgeConsumer(queue=queue, agent_graph=cluster_graph)
  task = asyncio.create_task(consumer.run())
  # ... later ...
  consumer.stop()
  await task

    """
    Async consumer that routes SensorEvents to cluster agent graphs.

    The consumer reads events one at a time from the queue, groups
    them by cluster_id, and invokes the cluster agent graph for each
    event.  Results (AnomalyFindings) are accumulated and can be
    retrieved via collected_findings.

    Parameters
    ──────────
    queue        : The SensorEventQueue to consume from.
    agent_graph  : A compiled LangGraph cluster agent graph.

    batch_size   : How many events to accumulate per cluster before
                   invoking the graph.  Default 1 = invoke per event.
