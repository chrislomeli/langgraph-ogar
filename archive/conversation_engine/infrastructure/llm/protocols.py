"""
LLM interaction protocols — the contract between graph nodes and LLM backends.

The conversation loop never imports openai, langchain_openai, or any
specific LLM library.  It calls through these protocols.  Swap the
implementation at graph construction time.

Design principles:
- Protocol, not ABC — structural subtyping, matches the ConversationContext pattern
- Request/Response are frozen dataclasses — immutable, serializable
- The protocol is synchronous — async support can wrap it later
