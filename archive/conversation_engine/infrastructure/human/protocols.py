"""
Human interaction protocols — the contract between graph nodes and human surfaces.

Symmetric with the LLM protocol layer.  The conversation loop never
imports readline, flask, or any specific UI library.  It calls through
these protocols.  Swap the implementation at graph construction time.

Design principles:
- Protocol, not ABC — structural subtyping, matches CallLLM pattern
- Request/Response are frozen dataclasses — immutable, serializable
- The protocol is synchronous — async support can wrap it later
