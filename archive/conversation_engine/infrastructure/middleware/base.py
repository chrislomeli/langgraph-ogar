"""
NodeMiddleware — the single ABC for all cross-cutting concerns.

Design:
  - Each middleware wraps the *entire* node execution via next_fn
  - Middleware can observe, transform, retry, short-circuit, inject config
  - Per-node selectivity via optional `nodes` set
  - Chain is built by InstrumentedGraph at add_node() time
  - Order matters: first in list = outermost wrapper

The signature:
    def __call__(self, node_name: str, state: dict, next_fn: Callable) -> dict

  - Call next_fn(state) to continue the chain (or execute the node)
  - Don't call it to short-circuit
  - Call it multiple times to retry
  - Transform state before or result after
